    "description": "This artwork represents the flow of life — a single line that shifts and changes, symbolizing persistence and continuity through challenges. It uses Perlin noise to create smooth, organic curves instead of jagged randomness, and a time variable animates the line slowly across the canvas. The system works by calculating vertical offsets for each horizontal point and drawing a continuous shape, producing a meditative, evolving visual that reflects resilience and subtle change."

    "description": "This sketch is a continuation of Flow of Life, evolving the original concept into a dynamic, multi-layered visualization. Multiple flowing lines ripple across the canvas, their shapes guided by layered Perlin noise, creating an organic, ever-changing rhythm. Colors shift over time, and subtle trails give the sense of currents and interactions, reflecting the complexity and beauty of life’s continuous motion."
