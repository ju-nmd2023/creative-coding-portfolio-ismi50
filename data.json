    "description": "This artwork represents the flow of life â€” a single line that shifts and changes, symbolizing persistence and continuity through challenges. It uses Perlin noise to create smooth, organic curves instead of jagged randomness, and a time variable animates the line slowly across the canvas. The system works by calculating vertical offsets for each horizontal point and drawing a continuous shape, producing a meditative, evolving visual that reflects resilience and subtle change."
